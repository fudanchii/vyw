Vyw
---

Browse your file, view images thumbnail, only nginx needed.  

Vyw structured around reactive programming, using [cyclejs](http://cycle.js.org/) with [most](https://github.com/cujojs/most) as its underlying base.

**Prerequisite**:

- Nginx > 1.9

Optionally, you may want nginx with image_filter module compiled to generate thumbnail.

**Installation**

- Get the latest release, or build yourself.
- Check nginx config in contrib folder, you can include that file to your main nginx config directly.
- Edit vyw.config.js file according to your setup.
- Restart nginx, open vyw index.html from your browser

**Development**

You will need recent nodejs and npm, the usual procedure for nodejs based project applied:
```
# cd to vyw source dir after clone
$ npm install

# Assuming gulp already installed globally
$ gulp build

# To automatically build files while developing
$ gulp watch
```

**Development Stack**

- [Nginx](http://nginx.org/)
- [Cyclejs](http://cycle.js.org/)
- [Most](https://github.com/cujojs/most)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [Livescript](http://livescript.net/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)


**Security Consideration**
Please be aware that Vyw doesn't employ any authorization nor it's implements any access restriction to the directory listing or files. Vyw were designed to be a simple files browser fully run on client (web browser). All access restriction should be implemented on the server. You may want, at least, to add [basic auth](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_basic_module.html) method to the directory listing on your nginx config, in addition of using https for everything.
